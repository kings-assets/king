## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant orange (#E67700) to convey energy and innovation, as orange suggests heat, motivation and vibrancy, all qualities aligned with Revive 2.0's identity. To avoid the association of the specific 'money app' color previously seen, a slightly more saturated variant on orange than what the user requested helps create distance from negative associations. It also has an exciting, revitalizing effect.
- Background color: Light orange (#F2EAE1) a desaturated tint from the primary color for a soothing backdrop.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#FFA500) for highlights and calls to action; create strong contrast without straying far from the analogous palette. Because the scheme is light, the accent is less bright.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for a stylish, attention-grabbing feel, suited for the world of fashion, art and design. It also handles short lines of body copy.
- Body font: 'Alegreya' (serif) which complements Belleza and is a reliable option for long blocks of text
- Use clean, modern icons to represent various services and features. Favor a simple line style with orange as the accent color. Consider SVG format for scalability.
- Maintain a clean and spacious layout with ample whitespace to improve readability. Employ a grid-based system for consistent alignment and responsiveness across devices.
- Incorporate subtle animations to enhance user engagement, such as fade-in effects, parallax scrolling, and interactive transitions. Use animations sparingly to avoid overwhelming the user.
