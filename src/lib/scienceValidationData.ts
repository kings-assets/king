    detailedExplanation: "Chronic pain is often locked deep within your body's soft tissues. We use precise Trigger Point Therapy to identify and release the hidden 'knots' that cause widespread discomfort and referred pain. This is complemented by therapeutic Deep Tissue Massage, which reaches the deepest layers of muscle and fascia to release chronic tension, break down adhesions, and restore blood flow. This dual approach ensures that even the most stubborn, long-standing tension is resolved at its source.",
