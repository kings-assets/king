The R8 System challenges this norm by leveraging cutting-edge science to accelerate healing by an astounding 3-5x compared to conventional methods. This isn't just an anecdotal claim; it's a result validated by over 47 clinical studies and years of application with diverse clientele." },

The <a href=\"/r8-stages/repair\" class=\"text-primary hover:underline font-semibold\">REPAIR</a> stage, for example, utilizes techniques like Photobiomodulation (PBM) and Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) therapy. PBM employs specific wavelengths of light to penetrate tissues, stimulating cellular repair processes at the mitochondrial level. This enhances ATP production – the energy currency of your cells – reduces inflammation, and promotes the synthesis of crucial proteins like collagen, which are vital for tissue regeneration." },
        { type: "paragraph", text: "PEMF, on the other hand, uses targeted energy fields to optimize cellular communication and promote natural healing processes. It can improve circulation, reduce pain, and accelerate the repair of bone and soft tissues. These technologies work synergistically to create an optimal environment for healing within the body." },
